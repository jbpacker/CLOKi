### Abstract
This paper investigates the survival success of a mobile robot evading a pursuer. The first section attempts to define preferable robot characteristics that will independently increase survival time for various environments. The second section seeks to answer whether or not adding randomness will aid in evading a predator. Multiple simulations were conducted for each section to gain complete and statistically relevant results. Ideal characteristics include preferring to avoid obstacles over running directly away from a predator, avoiding obstacles directly in front, but not on the sides, and updating the goal after specified intervals. By injecting randomness into the system, it was discovered that the average survival time decreased and the variance increased. This implies that while the likelihood of the robot surviving for a long time goes down, it has a small chance of surviving for an extraordinary amount of time. It was also discovered that survival time is highly dependent on room configuration and initial positions, which might effect this trend.
